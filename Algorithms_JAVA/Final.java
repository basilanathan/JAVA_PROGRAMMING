	 * 	- when applied to a variable (primitive) the value of the variable cannot change
	 * 	- when applied to a variable (reference) the reference object cannpt point to any 
	 * 		other object on the heap
	 * 	- when applied to a method- the method cannot be overwritten
	 *  - when applied to a class, the class cannot be subclassed
	 *  
	 * Finally - used in a try/catch block to ensure a segment of code is always executed
	 * 
	 * Finalize - method is called by the garbage collector once it determines that 
	 * no more references exist
