/**
 * Follow up for problem "Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node".
	
	What if the given tree could be any binary tree? Would your previous solution still work?
	
	Note:
	
	You may only use constant extra space.
	For example,
	Given the following binary tree,
	         1
	       /  \
	      2    3
	     / \    \
	    4   5    7
	After calling your function, the tree should look like:
	         1 -> NULL
	       /  \
	      2 -> 3 -> NULL
	     / \    \
	    4-> 5 -> 7 -> NULL
